					<h2>My Introduction</h2>
					<p>Hello, my name is Scott! I'm studying to become a web developer at Sacramento City College. Due to a scheduling mistake, this is actually one of the last classes I'll need to take before I can earn my web development certificate, so I already have some experience with this subject. I hope that you can tell by visiting this page. Before web development, I was interested in 3D art and animation. I learned programming for games first, but web development seems like a better field to be in professionally. I hope you enjoy my portfolio page!</p>
